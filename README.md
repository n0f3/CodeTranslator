CodeTranslator
==============

This is a simple project that I used as a learning experience to see if it was possible to utilize a converter to convert C# code to ActionScript.

I have interviewed with a company that had this same issue and were exploring viable options to achieve this goal.

My approach was to run CS2AS.exe as a process through a Unity Editor script, and then copy the translated files in a project folder.
